HighwayTalk (placeholder)

Problem

Drivers on highways lack a real-time, human, low-latency communication layer. Existing tools (horns, hazard lights, navigation apps) are indirect, slow, or non-interactive.

Solution

A hands-free, push-to-talk voice app for highway drivers that enables short-range, real-time communication, using license plates as temporary identities, optimized for safety.
